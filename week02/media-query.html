            <h2>Alma 13:3</h2>
            <p>"And this is the manner after which they were ordainedâ€”being called and prepared
                from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account
                of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose
                good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith,
                are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with,
                and according to, a preparatory redemption for such."

            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things
                which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto
                the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish
                the thing which he commandeth them."
